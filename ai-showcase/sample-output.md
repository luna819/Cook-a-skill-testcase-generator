## Test Case Summary

- **Feature:** Test Case Generator AI Skill
- **Generated:** 14 test cases
  - Happy Path: 3
  - Edge Case: 4
  - Negative Case: 7
- **Coverage notes:** Behavior when user provides a non-Markdown file (PDF/Word) was listed as out of scope in spec — included as a negative case to verify the skill handles it gracefully. Speed requirement (under 2 minutes) is noted but not verifiable via manual test steps alone.

## Happy Path Cases

### TC-001: Generate test cases from a complete, well-written spec

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Precondition:** The skill is loaded into an AI tool (Claude Project / Custom GPT / Dify); user has a valid `.md` spec file with feature description, user flows, input fields, validation rules, and business rules
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the AI tool with the skill loaded
  2. Paste or attach the `spec.md` content
  3. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill outputs a Test Case Summary block followed by grouped test cases (Happy Path / Edge Case / Negative Case); at least 10 test cases are generated; each case contains ID, Type, Priority, Precondition, Steps, Expected Result, and Test Data
- **Test Data:** Use `ai-showcase/sample-spec.md` (User Registration spec)

---

### TC-002: Generate test cases with optional testing type specified

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; user has a valid `spec.md`
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the spec content
  2. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases for this spec. Focus on API testing."
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates test cases with a focus on API-level scenarios (request/response validation, status codes, payload checks); output still follows the standard TC format
- **Test Data:** Any API-related spec; testing type: API

---

### TC-003: Generate test cases with priority focus specified

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec describes multiple modules (e.g., Registration + Login)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the spec content
  2. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases. Prioritize the Registration flow."
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates more thorough coverage for Registration (more edge/negative cases); Login cases may be present but fewer; output is still structured with all required fields
- **Test Data:** Spec with 2 modules; priority focus: Registration

---

## Edge Cases

### TC-004: Spec with only the minimum viable information

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec that contains only a brief feature description and a basic user flow — no input fields, no validation rules, no business rules
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates flow-based test cases only; a note is shown at the top of output: "No input fields or validation rules were found in the spec — only flow-based test cases are generated"; at least the happy path and basic negative cases are covered
- **Test Data:** Spec: "Users can view a list of products on the homepage. Clicking a product opens the product detail page."

---

### TC-005: Spec with complex, multi-constraint validation rules

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec contains a field with multiple constraints (e.g., length min/max + character type rules)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec where a Password field has rules: 8–32 chars, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates boundary test cases for the password field: exactly 7 chars (fail), exactly 8 chars (pass), exactly 32 chars (pass), exactly 33 chars (fail); also generates cases for each missing character type rule (no uppercase, no number, etc.)
- **Test Data:** Password field rules: 8–32 chars; must include uppercase, lowercase, number, special character

---

### TC-006: Spec describing two separate features

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Minor
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec that describes both a Login feature and a Forgot Password feature in the same document
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill separates the two features with distinct section headers (e.g., `## Login — Test Cases`, `## Forgot Password — Test Cases`); each section has its own TC-ID sequence starting from TC-001; each section has its own Summary block
- **Test Data:** Spec containing both Login and Forgot Password sections

---

### TC-007: Spec written in a language other than English

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Minor
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec written entirely in Vietnamese
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill successfully interprets the spec and generates test cases; output language matches the spec's language (Vietnamese); TC format structure is preserved
- **Test Data:** Vietnamese spec for any simple feature (e.g., đăng nhập, đặt hàng)

---

## Negative Cases

### TC-008: Spec is too vague — missing critical information

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec with only 1–2 sentences and no user flow, no fields, no rules (e.g., "This feature allows users to manage their profile.")
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill does NOT generate test cases immediately; instead it asks: "The spec is missing information about [user flows / input fields / validation rules]. Could you clarify before I proceed?"
- **Test Data:** Spec: "This feature allows users to manage their profile."

---

### TC-009: Spec contains ambiguous expected behavior

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec contains a rule without a defined outcome
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec where one rule has an undefined or vague expected outcome
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates the test case but flags the expected result with: "⚠️ Expected result needs clarification from PO"; all other test cases without ambiguity are generated normally
- **Test Data:** Spec rule: "If payment fails, the system handles the error." (no error message or behavior defined)

---

### TC-010: User provides no spec — empty input

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Send only the prompt: "Generate test cases" with no spec content attached or pasted
- **Expected Result:** Skill asks the user to provide a spec: "Please provide your spec.md content so I can generate test cases."
- **Test Data:** N/A (empty input)

---

### TC-011: User provides a PDF or Word file description instead of Markdown

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste content that is clearly from a non-Markdown source or send a message saying "I'm attaching a PDF"
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill informs the user that only `.md` (Markdown) spec files are supported and asks them to convert or re-provide the content in Markdown format
- **Test Data:** N/A

---

### TC-012: Spec describes a feature entirely out of the skill's scope

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Minor
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec describing a DevOps/infrastructure task (e.g., "Set up a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes")
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill either generates what it can (infra validation checks) or notes that the spec does not describe a software feature with user flows — and asks for clarification on what should be tested
- **Test Data:** Spec: "Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Deploy to AWS EC2 on merge to main."

---

### TC-013: Output contains fewer than 10 test cases for a complex spec

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; a complex spec (5+ flows, 5+ fields) is provided
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the User Registration sample spec (7 fields, 5 business rules, multi-step flow)
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates at least 10 test cases; output must not stop early or truncate; the Summary block accurately reflects the actual count
- **Test Data:** `ai-showcase/sample-spec.md`

---

### TC-014: Generated test case is missing a required field

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded and has generated output
- **Steps:**
  1. Provide any valid spec
  2. Review each generated test case in the output
- **Expected Result:** Every test case contains all 6 required fields: ID, Type, Priority, Precondition, Steps (at least 1 step), Expected Result; no field is blank or omitted; "Test Data" field is present even if value is "N/A"
- **Test Data:** Any spec
