## Test Case Summary

- **Feature:** Test Case Generator AI Skill
- **Generated:** 25 test cases
  - Happy Path: 3 (TC-001 to TC-003)
  - Edge Case: 9 (TC-004 to TC-007, TC-021 to TC-025)
  - Negative Case: 7 (TC-008 to TC-014)
  - Security Case: 6 (TC-015 to TC-020)
- **Security triggers detected:** N/A — this output tests the skill itself; Security Cases (TC-015–TC-020) verify the skill's ability to detect and generate security test cases, not triggered by signals in the skill's own spec.
- **Coverage notes:** Behavior when user provides a non-Markdown file (PDF/Word) was listed as out of scope in spec — included as a negative case to verify the skill handles it gracefully. Speed requirement (under 2 minutes) is noted but not verifiable via manual test steps alone. Security cases (TC-015 to TC-020) verify that the skill generates security-related test cases whenever the input spec contains user input fields, authentication flows, or token-based verification.

## Happy Path Cases

### TC-001: Generate test cases from a complete, well-written spec

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Spec Reference:** spec.md Section 3 (In Scope) + Section 8 DoD — skill must generate ≥10 fully structured TCs from any valid .md spec; output must include all required fields
- **Precondition:** The skill is loaded into an AI tool (Claude Project / Custom GPT / Dify); user has a valid `.md` spec file with feature description, user flows, input fields, validation rules, and business rules
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the AI tool with the skill loaded
  2. Paste or attach the `spec.md` content
  3. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill outputs a Test Case Summary block followed by grouped test cases (Happy Path / Edge Case / Negative Case / Security Case); at least 10 test cases are generated; each case contains ID, Type, Priority, Spec Reference, Precondition, Steps, Expected Result, and Test Data
- **Test Data:** Use `ai-showcase/sample-spec.md` (User Registration spec)

---

### TC-002: Generate test cases with optional testing type specified

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Major
- **Spec Reference:** spec.md Section 4 Input — "Testing type: Functional / UI / API (optional)"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; user has a valid `spec.md`
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the spec content
  2. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases for this spec. Focus on API testing."
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates test cases with a focus on API-level scenarios (request/response validation, status codes, payload checks); output still follows the standard TC format
- **Test Data:** Any API-related spec; testing type: API

---

### TC-003: Generate test cases with priority focus specified

- **Type:** Happy Path
- **Priority:** Major
- **Spec Reference:** spec.md Section 4 Input — "Priority focus: which module needs the most thorough testing (optional)"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec describes multiple modules (e.g., Registration + Login)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the spec content
  2. Send the prompt: "Generate test cases. Prioritize the Registration flow."
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates more thorough coverage for Registration (more edge/negative cases); Login cases may be present but fewer; output is still structured with all required fields
- **Test Data:** Spec with 2 modules; priority focus: Registration

---

## Edge Cases

### TC-004: Spec with only the minimum viable information

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Spec Reference:** SKILL.md Edge Case Handling — "No input fields or validation described → generate flow-based test cases only; note the limitation at the top of output"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec that contains only a brief feature description and a basic user flow — no input fields, no validation rules, no business rules
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates flow-based test cases only; a note is shown at the top of output: "No input fields or validation rules were found in the spec — only flow-based test cases are generated"; at least the happy path and basic negative cases are covered
- **Test Data:** Spec: "Users can view a list of products on the homepage. Clicking a product opens the product detail page."

---

### TC-005: Spec with complex, multi-constraint validation rules

- **Type:** Edge Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Spec Reference:** SKILL.md Step 2 Edge Case Handling — "Complex validation rules → generate boundary test cases (min-1, min, min+1, max-1, max, max+1)"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec contains a field with multiple constraints (e.g., length min/max + character type rules)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec where a Password field has rules: 8–32 chars, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates boundary test cases for the password field: exactly 7 chars (fail), exactly 8 chars (pass), exactly 32 chars (pass), exactly 33 chars (fail); also generates cases for each missing character type rule (no uppercase, no number, etc.)
- **Test Data:** Password field rules: 8–32 chars; must include uppercase, lowercase, number, special character

---

### TC-006: Spec describing two separate features

  1. Paste a spec written entirely in Vietnamese
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill successfully interprets the spec and generates test cases; output language matches the spec's language (Vietnamese); TC format structure is preserved
- **Test Data:** Vietnamese spec for any simple feature (e.g., đăng nhập, đặt hàng)

---

## Negative Cases

### TC-008: Spec is too vague — missing critical information

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Critical

- **Expected Result:** Skill does NOT generate test cases immediately; instead it asks: "The spec is missing information about [user flows / input fields / validation rules]. Could you clarify before I proceed?"
- **Test Data:** Spec: "This feature allows users to manage their profile."

---

### TC-009: Spec contains ambiguous expected behavior

- **Type:** Negative Case
- **Priority:** Major
- **Spec Reference:** SKILL.md Edge Case Handling — "Ambiguous or undefined expected behavior → flag with ⚠️ Expected result needs clarification from PO"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec contains a rule without a defined outcome
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste a spec where one rule has an undefined or vague expected outcome
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates the test case but flags the expected result with: "⚠️ Expected result needs clarification from PO"; all other test cases without ambiguity are generated normally

- **Expected Result:** Skill generates at least one test case verifying that: (a) the password value does not appear in the URL or any network response, (b) the password is not stored or logged in plain text; expected result references BR-05; case is labeled **Security Case / Critical**
- **Test Data:** Monitor network requests during registration; check server logs if accessible

---

### TC-018: Spec with verification token → skill generates token security test cases

- **Type:** Security Case
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Spec Reference:** SKILL.md Step 2 Security Rules — "Any token-based flow → generate token integrity test cases: (a) token reuse after first use, (b) tampered/guessed token"
- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec describes an email verification flow with a unique token link (Section 5 of sample-spec.md)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the User Registration spec
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
  3. Review for token-related security cases
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates the following token security cases:
  - Clicking an already-used verification link → system must invalidate it after first use and show an appropriate message
  - Clicking a verification link with a tampered/guessed token (e.g., incrementing the token value) → system rejects it
    Both cases are labeled **Security Case / Critical**
- **Test Data:** (a) Re-use the same verification link after account is verified; (b) Manually alter the `token=` parameter in the URL

---

### TC-019: Spec with form submission → skill generates rate limiting test case

- **Type:** Security Case

- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec describes a form with a submission action (Registration, Login, etc.)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the User Registration spec
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
  3. Review for brute force / rate limiting cases
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates a rate limiting test case: submitting the registration form repeatedly (e.g., 20+ times in quick succession, possibly via script) → system should throttle requests or show a CAPTCHA; even if CAPTCHA is out of scope in the spec, skill flags this as "⚠️ Rate limiting behavior not defined in spec — needs clarification from PO"
- **Test Data:** Automate form submission 20–50 times within 60 seconds using a test script or tool (e.g., Postman, JMeter)

---

### TC-020: Spec with state-changing form → skill generates CSRF test case

- **Precondition:** Skill is loaded; spec describes a form that modifies data on the server (account creation, profile update, etc.)
- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the User Registration spec
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
  3. Review for CSRF-related test cases
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates a CSRF test case: sending the registration POST request from an external origin without a valid CSRF token → server must reject the request (HTTP 403 or equivalent); test case is labeled **Security Case / Major**; if CSRF is not mentioned in spec, skill adds a note: "⚠️ CSRF protection not specified in spec — verify with dev team"
- **Test Data:** Craft a cross-origin POST request to `/register` endpoint using Postman or a custom HTML form hosted on a different domain

- **Steps:**
  1. Paste the User Registration spec
  2. Send: "Generate test cases for this spec"
  3. Review for Phone Number cases
- **Expected Result:** Skill generates the following cases:
  - Phone left empty → registration succeeds (field is optional)
  - Phone = 10 digits starting with `0` → passes
  - Phone = 9 digits → fails
  - Phone = 11 digits → fails
  - Phone starting with `1` (not `0`) → fails
  - Phone containing letters or special characters (e.g., `090-1234567`) → fails
- **Test Data:** (1) empty / (2) `0901234567` / (3) `090123456` / (4) `09012345678` / (5) `1901234567` / (6) `090-12345`
